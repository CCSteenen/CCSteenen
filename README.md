- 👋 Hey there, I’m @CCSteenen
- 👀 I’m a data professional balancing two worlds: hospital data integrity by day, freelance BI and analytics by night.
      My background in Innovation Sciences shapes how I tackle complex problems—mixing compliance-driven rigor with
      fast-paced, creative solutions.
      I’m well-versed in R, SQL, Power BI, Python, unit testing in Django, and a range of emerging data tools.
      No repos here yet, but stay tuned. I’ll be sharing projects that combine healthcare-grade standards with flexible,
      cutting-edge insights. In the meantime, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to discuss new ideas or collaborate
      on data-driven challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data wrangling for healthcare analytics, with a focus on integrating secure BI
      solutions into fast-paced environments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on compliance-focused data projects, building robust pipelines and insightful
      dashboards that drive real-world impact.
